<p>	This is an example of tabbed subviews that are loaded from the main view and are capable of refreshing their
	own content.  An ajax call can easily be added to pull the content dynamically from the server.

	Backbone.js is a great framework with a lot of flexibility and as such it can be difficult to
	settle on a development pattern. This is my preferred implementation and project structure.

	Included is also a simple template loader.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ccoenraets">@ccoenraets</a> for
	the template loader code and a lot of great examples.
